    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We are pleased that you are using our Gprompt application (hereinafter
      referred to as the "app"). In the following, we will inform you about the
      handling of your personal data when using our app. Personal data includes
      all data with which you can be personally identified.
    </p>
    <h1>How We Handle Your Data</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        All of your data, including prompts and shared links, are stored locally
        on your app using Local Storage.
      </li>
      <li>
        The entire app runs on your device; we don't have a backend server to
        collect data on the server side.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you send a message on ChatGpt, the app switches to OpenAI's ChatGpt
        web interface.
      </li>
      <li>
        Chat requests and other actions are triggered by JavaScript, and no
        other API requests are performed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Chat requests are handled by ChatGpt, and there is no middle server. No
        one else can see the requests, responses, and their content.
      </li>
      <li>
        Every interaction and data shared on the ChatGpt web interface are
        governed by OpenAI's Privacy Policy.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Contact</h1>
    <ul>
      When contacting us (e.g., via a contact form or email), personal data is
      collected. The data collected when using a contact form can be seen from
      the respective contact form in the app. This data is stored and used
      exclusively for the purpose of answering your request or for contacting
      you and the associated technical administration. The legal basis for
      processing this data is our legitimate interest in answering your request
      in accordance with Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR. If your contact is aimed
      at concluding a contract, the additional legal basis for processing is
      Art. 6(1)(b) of the GDPR. Your data will be deleted once your request has
      been processed. This is the case if it can be inferred from the
      circumstances that the facts in question have been finally clarified and
      provided that there are no legal storage obligations to the contrary.
    </ul>
    <h1>Cookies</h1>
    <ul>
      The use of cookies for the process of finding user login state may be done
      entirely in the local storage.
    </ul>

    <h1>Advertising Partners</h1>
    <ul>
      Google Ads are used, and they are responsible for their own privacy
      policy.
    </ul>
    <ul>
      Your privacy is important to us. It is Gprompt's policy to respect your
      privacy regarding any information we may collect from you across our app.
      We only ask for personal information when we truly need it to provide a
      service to you. We collect it by fair and lawful means, with your
      knowledge and consent. We also let you know why we're collecting it and
      how it will be used.
    </ul>
    <p>This policy is effective as of 30 September 2022.</p>
